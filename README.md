## 7-in-7 Prototypes


```markdown

Over the course of seven days, students will produce seven discrete prototypes. Each prototype should pose and
answer a question the student’s assumptions about the project, their research, and proposal. Each will be
started and finished in a single day.

For each prototype, answer all four of the below questions: 

1 -What did I make?
2 -How did I make it? 
3 -What did making it help me understand? 
4 -How might this new understanding inform my thesis project moving forward?

### DAY 1

#### 1. A pillow

2. I made a pillow using e-textile and LEDs. 
Instructions: When you meditate with the app, the pillow -placed on your bed- glows. And then it gently fades. Goal: motivation, reminder.

3. I wanted to see whether a motivational physical object will actually make the user meditate more or not. This project won’t be a help in the meditation process itself, it’s more like an external motivation object that gives the user some decorative results as a reward. When I showed this pillow to my audience they liked to engage with it and turn the LEDs on.

### DAY 2
#### 1. An app

2. I used Adobe UX and illustrator. This iaap is used by people who do not meditate because of the lack of discipline, this app blocks the accessibility to all user’s social media unless he/she uses the meditation app first (every day and you cannot turn it off)

3. I wanted to do an experiment with an entirely different medium. This project does not include crafting. Through my research, I figured out that one of the reasons that one doesn’t meditate enough it laziness and the lack of discipline. I wanted to see if this project could be a response to this problem

### DAY 3
#### 1. An App

2. I used adobe XD and illustrator. My goeal was to make a community, support group that helps users gain motivation. You upload your stitching piece every day and get points/rewards and level up.

3. I wanted to explore the effects of having a supportive community in the meditation process. I call it social media for meditation. I wanted to see if I can come up with a platform that motivates, encourages and give rewards.
