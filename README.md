## 7-in-7 Prototypes


```markdown

Over the course of seven days, students will produce seven discrete prototypes. Each prototype should pose and
answer a question the student’s assumptions about the project, their research, and proposal. Each will be
started and finished in a single day.

For each prototype, answer all four of the below questions: 

1 -What did I make?
2 -How did I make it? 
3 -What did making it help me understand? 
4 -How might this new understanding inform my thesis project moving forward? 

```
