# 7-in-7 Prototypes


```markdown

Over the course of seven days, students will produce seven discrete prototypes. Each prototype should pose and
answer a question the student’s assumptions about the project, their research, and the proposal. Each will be
started and finished in a single day.

For each prototype, answer all four of the below questions: 

1 -What did I make?
2 -How did I make it? 
3 -What did making it help me understand? 
4 -How might this new understanding inform my thesis project moving forward? 

```


### DAY 1

#### A pillow
 
1. When you meditate with the app, the pillow -placed on your bed- glows. And then it gently fades. Goal: motivation, reminder.

2. I made a pillow using e-textile and LEDs.

3. I wanted to see whether a motivational physical object will actually make the user meditate more or not. This project won’t be a help in the meditation process itself, it’s more like an external motivation object that gives the user some decorative results as a reward. When I showed this pillow to my audience they liked to engage with it and turn the LEDs on.

## DAY 2
#### An app

1. This app is used by people who do not meditate because of the lack of discipline, this app blocks the accessibility to all user’s social media unless he/she uses the meditation app first (every day and you cannot turn it off)

2. I used Adobe UX and illustrator. 

3. I wanted to do an experiment with an entirely different medium. This project does not include crafting. Through my research, I figured out that one of the reasons that one doesn’t meditate enough it laziness and the lack of discipline. I wanted to see if this project could be a response to this problem

4. 

## DAY 3
#### An App

1. My goal was to make a community, support group that helps users gain motivation. You upload your stitching piece every day and get points/rewards and level up.

2. I used Adobe XD and illustrator. 

3. I wanted to explore the effects of having a supportive community in the meditation process. I call it social media for meditation. I wanted to see if I can come up with a platform that motivates, encourages and give rewards. 

4.

### DAY 4
#### A crafting activity (Not Goal-oriented)

1. This activity is designed for people who do not like to make things for a purpose.

2. Using stitching, embroidery, e-textile.

3.

## DAY 5
#### A crafting activity (Goal-oriented)

1. This activity is designed for goal-oriented people who like to make things for a purpose.

2. Using stitching, embroidery, e-textile.

3.

4.


## DAY 6
#### A digital Coloring book

1. An app. This is a coloring app made like a big puzzle. Each day the user color one piece and in the end, she/he can see the final colored result in the big picture.

2. An iPad, using a pencil.

3. This prototype is an iteration of my coloring book experiment that I did last semester (asked users to color while reading their brainwaves). I wanted to see if I can emerge the normal coloring activity from an iPad in a digital form.

4.


## DAY 7
#### ML

1. A new pattern generated with machine learning every day, so the user does not have to spend time on the pattern he/she wants to stitch on.

2. Using machine learning, fabric, a needle, and embroidery threads. 

3. 

4. 


### EXTRAS

#### A jewelry collection about mindfulness.
